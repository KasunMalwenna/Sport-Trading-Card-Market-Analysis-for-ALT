# Sport-Trading-Card-Market-Analysis-for-ALT

This project is part of a collabarative tech sprint among Data science, UX design and Web Development students challenging to create digital solutions for one of [BrainStation's](https://brainstation.io/) industry partners - [ALT](https://www.alt.xyz/)(a leading sports trading card marketplace).

Sports trading cards can be considered an alternative investment opportunity because the market for these cards can be relatively stable and can offer a potential for high returns. The value of a card is often determined by its rarity, condition, and the popularity of the athlete featured on the card. Some high-value cards have sold for millions of dollars. However, it's important to note that the market for sports cards can be highly speculative and illiquid, and like any other investment, it carries risk. It's also important to conduct research and due diligence before investing in sports cards, as well as to have a long-term horizon.

The USA trading card market is arguably the most prominent and active market there is, and this project focuses on the largest lister in the USA region, eBay, to analyze and compile relevant insights and make recommendations for ALT to provide context and motivation for improvement and future development.
